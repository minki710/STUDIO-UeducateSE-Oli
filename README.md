This project is to create a learning device to assist in object recognition for someone that has learning differences. 

Hardware:
Kittenbot Meowbit (1)
20 pin IO Board (1)
Button modules (4)
Neopixels soldered to buttons (4)
Acrylic cylinders as large buttons
3D printed enclosure base
Laser cut enclosure top

The Meowbit displays one of four images randomly. The user then pushes the corresponding button that matches the image. If it is correct, the button will flash and a new image will appear. If it is incorrect, the image will reappear.
